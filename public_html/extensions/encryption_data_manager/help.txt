<b>Requirement:</b> PHP => 5.3 and openSSL enabled
<br>(Contact your server admin or hosting company)<br>
NOTE: Do not confuse SSL data encryption with signed SSL certificates (HTTPS) used for browser access to sites 
<br><br>
<b>1. Configuration:</b> <br>
Add key storage location path. <br>
Add below lines to /system/config.php file. <br>
<br>
<b>	define('ENCRYPTION_KEYS_DIR', '/path/to/keys/');</b><br>
<b>	define('DATA_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED', true);</b><br>
<b>	define('ENCRYPTED_POSTFIX', '_enc');</b><br>
<br>
Change path to your specific path on your server and it has to be writable/readable only to webserver
<br><br>

<b>2. Generate New Key:</b>
<br><br>in Encryption Data Tools generate new key with some unique key name provided (no spaces or special characters). Remember that name 
<br><br>
Add below line to /system/config.php file with key name used in generate step <br>
<b>	define('DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEYPAIR', 'your_key_name');</b><br>
This is the key name that you used above

<br><br>
<b>2. Encrypt all data:</b> <br>
Now you need to hide all the data that you might have already at this point using new key that you have created. 
<br> You can do this in Encryption Data Tools. Just follow the steps for "data encryption" process 

<br><br>
NOTES: <br>
1. Keep Key in secure location with restricted file permissions for root and apache (webserver)<br>
3. Backup your keys in some remote secure location. Lost keys will cause loss of all data<br>
3. There is no key expiration management. <br>
These needs to be accounted for in key management procedures
